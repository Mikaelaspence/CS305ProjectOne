**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company that is looking to enhance their security features and meet industry best practices. They seek to develop individualized financial plans to their customers that include savings, retirement, and investments. They are hoping to protect their companies from external threats. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Coding securely is a very important step in ensuring that information is protected and vulnerabilities are minimized. Software security is important to prevent injection attacks, DoS attacks, and many other types of security vulnerabilities. These attacks can prevent software from working, can comprimise customer personal information, and the private workings within a company. If coding is not done securely, money can be lost, information can be stolen, and a company's reputation can be ruined. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I found it challenging to determine what were true threats and false positives. Sometimes a vulnerability sounded very serious (and may be) but it is a known vulneravility and there is not yet a fix. I found it difficult to determine when to suppress something that we know could be a threat but there isn't anything to be done about it. It was insteresting to learn about the different vulnerabilities that exist, however, and what sort of mitigation techniques can be used. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Checking for vulnerabilities was one was to increase securities. Knowing how to look at a vulnerability report was helpful, and learning when to suppress vulnerabiities. I have learned how using a RESTful API can be helpful, as well as secure coding practicies, good error handling, and input validation. Also, using HTTPS instead of HTTP and TSL/SSL servers can improve security. Using a reliable cipher algorithm is also very important. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ran reports and re-ran them to make sure that no new vulnerabilties were introduced. Running a vulnerability report helped me to chekc that my software was secure. In addition, doing a manual review of the code was helpful. Using the correct acceptable cipher algorithms and running/testing/retesting the code ensured that my software was secure and functional. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I think learning how to generate a certificate, as well as making a checksum were helpful tools from this course that I had never used before. I had also never heard of a vulnerabiity report and can see using that in the future as well. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

I would show them my completed report. This shows an understanding of how to run a dependency report, as well as how to read it. There are descriptions of understanding the clients' needs, areas of security that need to be addressed based on those needs, and examples of a manual review and static testing. Finally, the mitigation plan describes ways to work with these vulnerabilities and improve code to meet best practices and industry standards.
